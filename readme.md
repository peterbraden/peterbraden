This is the github of [Peter Braden](https://peterbraden.co.uk); allegedly I've
been using this site for both professional and personal projects since 2008.
Consequently, there is a lot of code here of very variable quality and relevance.

If you're interested in my professional achievements, you are better suited
looking at my [resume](https://peterbraden.co.uk/resume), or reading more 
[about me](https://peterbraden.co.uk/about) on my website.

If you're interested in the tools that a dinosaur like myself uses, then
my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/peterbraden/dotfiles) is likely of interest.
